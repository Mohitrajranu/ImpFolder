Step1:Make the following directory listed below on the path: Go to the path:cd /home/mbas/BackEndProcess and enter the below command
mkdir AutoChurnDir

Step2:Go to the path:cd /home/mbas/BackEndProcess/config and edit the Property file Constants.properties and add the below listed parameter inside the property file and save the file.
deleteProcessServiceType =Z0014#(Single Service at a time )
deleteProcessFileWrite =1#(0 or 1,in case of delete without writing file enter 0 and in case of delete with file writing of the that service type enter 1)
deleteProcessRecLimit =20

deleteProcessCustStatus =C
deleteProcessModeOfApplication =C(For continous Mode i.e., to run script continously type:C, or in order to run onetime type:E)
deleteProcessBatchSize =20
deleteProcessSleepTime =12000
deleteProcessSleepTimeMultiplier =2
deleteProcessChurnFileDir =/home/mbas/BackEndProcess/AutoChurnDir/
deleteProcessChurnFileName =AUTOCHURNFILE

Step 3:Upload the  java file:SEConstantsI.java on the following location:cd /home/mbas/BackEndProcess/src/com/btsl/util/common
Now Go to this path: cd /home/mbas/BackEndProcess/src and compile the java files by entering the below commands:
javac -d ../classes/ com/btsl/util/common/SEConstantsI.java


Step4:Upload the 2 java files:DeleteChurnVo.java and DeleteChurnProcess.java on the following location:cd /home/mbas/BackEndProcess/src/com/btsl/process
Now Go to this path: cd /home/mbas/BackEndProcess/src and compile the java files by entering the below commands:
javac -d ../classes/ com/btsl/process/DeleteChurnVo.java
javac -d ../classes/ com/btsl/process/DeleteChurnProcess.java

Step5:Upload the script file DeleteChurnProcess.sh on the following location  /home/mbas/BackEndProcess/cronjobs and provide permission to the script chmod +x DeleteChurnProcess.sh

Step6:Go to the path cd /home/mbas/BackEndProcess/cronjobs and run the script DeleteChurnProcess.sh by just entering ./DeleteChurnProcess.sh don't schedule the script on a crontab.
