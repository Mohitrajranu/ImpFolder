Apache Nifi::
Automate the flow of data between systems; eg JSON -> Database,FTP -> Hadoop,Kafka -> ElasticSearch, etc.
Drag and Drop Interface; Focus on configuration of processors(i.e. what matters only to the user) ; scalable across a cluster of machines ; Guaranteed Delivery/No data loss
Data buffering / back pressure /prioritization Queuing/Latency  vs Throughput.

FlowFile :: Its basically the data , comprised of two elements,
Content -> the data itself and attributes -> key value pairs associated with the data.
Gets persisted to disk after creation.

Processor ::  Applies a set of transformations and rules in flowfiles to generate new flowfiles.
Any processor can process any flowfile.
Processors are passing flow file references to each other to advance the data processing, they are all running in parallel different threads.

Connector :: Its basically queue of flow files yet to be processed by  processor 2.Define rules how flow files are prioritized,can define backpressure to aviod overflow in the system.

Add processor by clicking on the popup and drag it to the center of the screen.

Filter Getfile , select it  then right click on it and select configure, set properties .
Similarly Create PutFile Processors, and connect these two processors using Connection , 

FlowFile Topology :: A flowfile has two components ,
Attributes :: These are the metadata from the flowfile. Contain information about the content eg , when was it created where it is from what data does it represent.
Content :: That's the actual content of the flowfile , eg it's the actual content of the file you would read using Getfile.

A processor can :: update,add or remove attributes ; change content.

Download template from site and import it inside Nifi blow by clicking upload option in generate nifi flow.
Now from the top menu you can select the uploaded templates. You can configure the flow by right click on the selected flow.

Nifi supports the use of attributes using expression language, Right click on any flow and select data provenance option.
You can configure LogAttribute or Routeattribute for unmatched value.
Create Processor Group Json To MongoDb.
Create processor GetFile and connect to the other processor PutMongo.

Apache Nifi to Apache Kafka
::-- > Apache Nifi can be an alternative to kafka connect framework
Apache Nifi is useful for building data pipelines , by only configuration just using a mere drag & drop,
