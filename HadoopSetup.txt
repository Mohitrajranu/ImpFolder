HDFS Read & Write :: 
A hadoop cluster has 2 types of node ::--> 
In a cluster you can have only one namenode but multiple datanodes.
Namenode[master] => HDFS metadata(list of block locations for a particular file , who created them and when created/modified) and block locations,
suppose a client wants to read a data from hdfs then hdfs fetches list of block locations from namenode , if the replication factor is 3 then 3 datalocations will be returned ,
hdfs will also sort the data locations based on the proximity(Node Proximity --> Nodes that are on the same rack) of the client 

Write operation::
While writing to hdfs , client requests block location from namenode which checks if the client has necessary write permissions , the block location are provided on the basis Replica 
Placement strategy , for replication factor 3  first node will be on the same rack  as client , the other two node will be on different rack say rack2.


Datanode[slave] => Stores actual blocks

MapReduce::
Distributed programming model for large data sets , MapReduce is not a programming language .Hadoop implements mapreduce .MapReduce System(Hadoop) -> Manage communications, data 
transfers parallel execution across distributed servers.
MapReduce is basically carried out in 3 phase:
Map phase --> Input split -->Mappers--> stores data in key value pair
Dataset is divided in to multiple parts - Input Splits, Each mapper process an input split.Each mapper can be called multiple times depending on the content of input split.
Mapper will emit key value pairs as output, there will be one or more mapper in a MapReduce job.

Shuffle phase --> Aggregated the data from multiple source to a final target system.
Reduce phase --> Reducers--> Result
Reduce function will take key value pairs from multiple map functions as input and reduce them to output, keys are grouped with values.Reduce function is called once per key and its values.
There could be 0,1 or more Reduce function for a mapReduce job.
It is advisable to have more than one reducers if you are dealing with multiple mappers.It is important to understand that partitioning happens across all the mappers in the map phase.
Combiner is a mini reducer that runs at map phase. You can use your reducer class as combiner only if your final output with and without combiner is going to remain same.
InputFormat :: Validate inputs ; Input files into logical inputSplits; RecordReader implementation to extract logical records.
OutputFormat :: Validate output specifications [checks if the directory exists or not, will throw error if directory is already there] ; RecordWriter implementation to write output
files of the job.
Writable :: A serializable object which implements a simple,efficient,serialization protocol. Fast,Compact & Effective

create an executable jar and copy it to haddop cluster.
Hdfs input location :: /users/hirw/input/stocks
HDFS output location (relative to user):
output/mapReduce/stocks
hadoop fs -rm -r output/mapReduce/stocks

submit job: hadoop jar 
haddop jar /hive-starterkit/mapReduce/stocks/MaxClosePrice.jar com.hirw.maxcloseprice.MaxClosePrice /users/hirw/input/stocks output/mapReduce/stocks 
view results
haddop fs -cat output/mapReduce/stocks/part-1-00000




1. Create directory "mrinput" on hdfs

hadoop fs -mkdir mrinput


2. Move the book file to HDFS in above directory
hadoop fs -moveFromLocal 98.txt mrinput

3. Execute the below command
hadoop jar wordcountnew.jar wordcountnew <SRC File> mroutput
hadoop jar wordcountnew.jar wordcountnew mrinput/98-0.txt mroutput

4. Download the output in linux
hadoop fs -cat mroutput/part-r-00000
5. View the content of file (processed file)

hadoop fs -ls /apps/hive/warehouse

Apache Pig::
Client tool developed at yahoo, same implementation phases as MapReduce program.
Pig Latin
Simple to use dataflow language, instruction to process data given by the user.Pig analyze,optimize the instructions and construct and submit MR jobs.
PIG Latin instructions :: Load -> Filter ->Group->Aggregate(avg,max)->Store

Philosophy 1:: Pig eats anything(Metadata or not,Structured or not)
Philosophy 2:: Pigs fly[Designed with Big Data performance requirements in mind]
Philosophy 3:: Pigs are domestic Animals(Designed to be easily controlled and modified by users).
Philosophy 4:: Pigs live Anywhere(Pig authors envision pig to work on any distributed processing frameworks similar to hadoop in future)

To interact with pig you need a grunt shell , simply type pig and it will take you the grunt shell in console.

### LOADING A DATASET ###

grunt> stocks = LOAD '/user/hirw/input/stocks' USING PigStorage(',') as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:datetime, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float,
volume:int, adj_close:float);

delimeter is ',' which is denotated using pigStorage and every column of the stock file is taken into consideration along with there datatype
### STRUCTURE ###
To know the structure of relation we just created above , we will use the describe command desc
grunt> DESC stocks;

### PROJECT AND MANIPULATE FEW COLUMNS FROM DATASET ###

grunt> projection = FOREACH stocks GENERATE symbol, SUBSTRING($0, 0, 1) as sub_exch, close - open as up_or_down;

### PRINT RESULT ON SCREEN ###

grunt> DUMP projection;

### STORE RESULT IN HDFS ###

grunt> STORE projection INTO 'output/pig/simple-projection';

### LOAD 1 - WITH NO COLUMN NAMES AND DATATYPES ###

grunt> stocks = LOAD '/user/hirw/input/stocks' USING PigStorage(',');
describe stocks --> will ask for schema , you can run projection command to generate schems explicitly.

### LOAD 2 - WITH COLUMN NAMES BUT NO DATATYPES ###

grunt> stocks = LOAD '/user/hirw/input/stocks' USING PigStorage(',') as (exchange, symbol, date, open, high, low, close, volume, adj_close);
describe stocks --> will generate schema with default datatype as bytearray.
### LOAD 3 - WITH COLUMN NAMES AND DATATYPES ###

grunt> stocks = LOAD '/user/hirw/input/stocks' USING PigStorage(',') as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:datetime, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float,
volume:int, adj_close:float);

### TO LOOK UP STRUCTURE OF THE RELATION ###

grunt> DESCRIBE stocks;

### WHEN COLUMN NAMES ARE NOT AVAILABLE ###

grunt> projection = FOREACH stocks GENERATE $1 as symbol, SUBSTRING($0, 0, 1) as sub_exch, $6 - $3 as up_or_down;

1. Install a JDK (Java Development Kit) from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html . Keep track of where you installed the JDK; you’ll need that later.

2. Download a pre-built version of Apache Spark from https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html

3. If necessary, download and install WinRAR so you can extract the .tgz file you downloaded. http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm

4. Extract the Spark archive, and copy its contents into C:\spark after creating that directory. You should end up with directories like c:\spark\bin, c:\spark\conf, etc.

5. Move winutils.exe (Download from - https://s3.amazonaws.com/sankethadoop/winutils.exe) into a C:\winutils\bin folder that you’ve created. (note, this is a 64-bit application. If you are on a 32-bit version of Windows, you’ll need to search for a 32-bit build of winutils.exe for Hadoop.)

6. Open the the c:\spark\conf folder, and make sure “File Name Extensions” is checked in the “view” tab of Windows Explorer. Rename the log4j.properties.template file to log4j.properties. Edit this file (using Wordpad or something similar) and change the error level from INFO to ERROR for log4j.rootCategory

7. Right-click your Windows menu, select Control Panel, System and Security, and then System. Click on “Advanced System Settings” and then the “Environment Variables” button.

8. Add the following new USER variables:
a. SPARK_HOME c:\spark
b. JAVA_HOME (the path you installed the JDK to in step 1, for example C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101)
c. HADOOP_HOME c:\winutils

9. Add the following paths to your PATH user variable: %SPARK_HOME%\bin; %JAVA_HOME%\bin

10. Close the environment variable screen and the control panels.

11. Install the latest Scala IDE from http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html

12. Test it out!
a. Open up a Windows command prompt in administrator mode.
b. Enter cd c:\spark and then dir to get a directory listing.
c. Look for a text file we can play with, like README.md or CHANGES.txt
d. Enter spark-shell
e. At this point you should have a scala> prompt. If not, double check the steps above.
f. Enter val rdd = sc.textFile(“README.md”) (or whatever text file you’ve found)
g. Enter rdd.count()
h. You should get a count of the number of lines in that file! Congratulations, you just ran your first Spark program!
i. Hit control-D to exit the spark shell, and close the console window
j. You’ve got everything set up! Hooray!
