Apache Flink :: open source stream processing framework for distributed,high performing , always available data streaming applications
Flink is a true processing framework, flinks stream is based on windowing and checkpointing, flink is implemented in java and has its own automatic memory manager , rarely gets out of memory. Flink uses controlled cyclic dependency graph as its execution engine.
It also provides support for batch processing , grapgh processing,iterative processing.
Flink gives low latency and high throughput applications. Robust,fault-tolernce, application can restart from exactly same point where it failed.
Flink has rich set of libraries for graph processing,Machine learning,String handling,relational apis etc.
Flink's application state is rescalable,possible to add resources while app is running.also maintains exactly-once semantics.
