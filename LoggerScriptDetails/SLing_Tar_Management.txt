f you had to stop AEM to avoid disk space growth then use the commands below to do some initial analysis.

On Linux platform, leverage the du command to list all directories under crx-quickstart with the summarized size of those directories:

du -h --max-depth=2 crx-quickstart

Use find and du commands to find recently modified files and get their sizes:

find crx-quickstart -type f -mtime 1 -exec du -hs {} \; -print

To find large files in the datastore, you can combine find, du and file commands to find files over 100MB in the datastore directory and auto-identify their file type:

find crx-quickstart/repository/datastore -type f -size +100M -exec sh -c "du -hs \"{}\"; file \"{}\"" \;

If you find that the growth is occuring in the segmentstore directory then the command below can help give some clues as to what data is being written:

strings data_xxxxxx.tar | egrep '^.?/' | sed 's/.$//;s/^.\//\//'
