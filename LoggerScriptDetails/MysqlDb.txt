tep 1. Remove MySQL
First step is to remove the MySQL package from the CentOS 7 server.For this just run the following command.

# yum remove mysql mysql-server
Step 2. Remove MySQL Data Directory
By default MySQL data directory path is /var/lib/mysql. Instead of removing MySQL data directory we will suggest you just rename this directory to keep a backup of the old settings. You can rename this directory like old_backup_mysql.

# mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/old_backup_mysql 
READ: How to Take Backup and Restore the MySQL Database.

Step 3. Now Install MySQL Again
In the above steps, MySQL server packages removed. MySQL data directory also deleted/renamed. Now finally again we will install the MySQL packages.

# yum install mysql mysql-server
This will create new mysql data directory under the default path i.e. /var/lib.

Restart

/etc/init.d/mysqld restart


Start

/etc/init.d/mysqld start


Stop

/etc/init.d/mysqld stop

The default root password is blank (i.e. empty string) not root. So you can just login as:

mysql -u root
You should obviously change your root password after installation

mysqladmin -u root password [newpassword]


Grant All Privileges ON . to 'root'@'%' Identified By 'password';
then

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
/etc/init.d/mysqld restart

mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('MyNewPass') WHERE User='root';
