						Clean-Up API Flow
						-----------------------

1. get list of subscription based on below parameters to de-activate service.
	
	if (crmId != null)
		then select Based on crmId
	else if (custServiceId != null)
		then select Based on custServiceId
	else
		return

2. Along with above mandatory parameters below optional parameters/conditions are applied get de-activation list.

	msisdn
	serviceType
	subscriptionId
	planRefKey
	
	with order by serviceId in descending order.

3. Process deactivation based on dynamic query list.

   3.1 - In below scenarios application skips deactivation of subscriptions.
	 a. In case of non regulatory base pack request, base pack won't de-activate.(Ex. Jio Drive Scenarios, where toneType=BS).
	 b. In case of Jio Security plan change request if record present in source & Destination - no need to deactivate anything call service switching.
	 c. In case of status is in churn state(C) with errorCode=3018, errorDescription="Dear subscriber, You have already unsubscribed this service".

   3.1 - If current status is 'E' 
	a. Delete from callback retry based on subscriptionId.
	b. In case of CRBT service integration then delete from callback retry where parenet subscription id = subscriptionId.(delete linking service as TONE)

   3.2 - If current status is 'I' 
	Delete from callback retry JS based on subscriptionId.

4. Below is the list of scenarios where application stop callback.

   4.1 - If current status is 'I'
   4.2 - If current operation is 'NPF'or jio drive planChange request
   4.3 - if Same service switching request and service contain in configured service list

5. Check Plan level deactMode = F(Future)/I(Immediate) in a Property File

   5.1 - If Plan level deactMode = F(Future)

	Stop renewal(autoRenew, modifiedOn, operation) 
	Note : Optimization require(Instead of updating composite primary key update require based on subscriptionId).

   5.2 - If Plan level deactMode = I(Immediate)

	If churnImmediateDelete	= Y 
		then delete records from service info.
	else 
		update service info with status as Churn(status, operation, modifiedOn, deactivationDate, modifiedBy, bearerId).

   5.5 - Insert into hist//commented.

6. Process package and link service un-subscription.

	6.1 - In case of package/Combo
		a. In case of CRBT integration delete from callback retry where parent subscription id = subscriptionId.(delete linking service as TONE)
		b. De-Activate link service of combo.//commented.
		   Follow step of 6.2-b
		c. De-Activate Linked Service of child service.
		   Follow step of 6.2-b
		   		
	6.2 - In case of Individual service.
		a. In case of CRBT integration delete from callback retry where parent subscription id = subscriptionId.(delete linking service as TONE)
		b. De-Activate link service of individual service.//commented.
		   if deactMode = F(Future)
			Stop renewal (autoRenew, modifiedOn, operation)
		   else deactMode = I(Immediate)
			If churnImmediateDelete	= Y 
				then delete records from service info.
			else 
				update service info with status as Churn(status, operation, modifiedOn, deactivationDate, modifiedBy, bearerId).
					
7. Send Callback if not stop

	7.1 - If callback not success then insert into callback retry for retry purpose.
		Update Cust Status based on ServiceSwitchFlag(status, operation, modifiedOn, modifiedBy, bearerId).

		a. if ServiceSwitchFlag = Sequential
		   Update status = currentStatus, operation = currentOperation in service Info
		   return with errorCode=50015, errorDesc = "Service Switing not allowded due to your previous de-activation request is pending on platform"
		   No trxn log will print.//Need to check this scenarios.
		b. else 
		   Update status='D', operation = 'DPF' in service Info

	7.2 - If callback success.
	      a. If Integration Type is Jio Security
		 	delete from Jio Security Success
		 	delete from Jio Security retry table
	      	 else if ServiceSwitchFlag is SEQUENTIAL(S)
			Update Cust Status as C in service Info(status, operation, modifiedOn, deactivationDate, modifiedBy, bearerId).
	      b. Delete from SubsCallbackRetry based on subscriptionId.
		 
8. Generate SDR
	In case of process success generate SDR based on sdr generation approach(DB/File/Both DB and File).

9. Create Trxn Log

	9.1 - Create Sub Request Trxn Log
	9.2 - Create Request Trxn Log after end of dynamic query deAct list

10. Send Notification.
	Send Email and SMS based on MSG_TYPE{SMS, Email, SMS_Email} configuration.
