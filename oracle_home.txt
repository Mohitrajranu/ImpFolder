SQL> create table emp ( emp_id number(10),
fname varchar2(25),
lname varchar2(25),
constraint pk_emp_id PRIMARY KEY(emp_id)
);

Now let’s create a sequence.

SQL> Create sequence emp_sequence start with 1
increment by 1
minvalue 1
maxvalue 10000;

Now we have created a sequence object named emp_sequence with starting value as 1 and incrementing by 1 from 1 (minvalue) to 10000 (maxvalue).

Now let’s insert the values into emp table.

SQL> insert into emp (emp_id,fname,lname) values(emp_sequence.nextval,'Darvin','Johnson'); SQL> insert into emp (emp_id,fname,lname) values(emp_sequence.nextval,'Mig','Andrews');
SQL> insert into emp (emp_id,fname,lname) values(emp_sequence.nextval,'Alex','Martin');
SQL> insert into emp (emp_id,fname,lname) values(emp_sequence.nextval,'Jon','paul');
SQL> insert into emp (emp_id,fname,lname) values(emp_sequence.nextval,'Yatin','Bones');



Hi Mohit,

As explained you find below path in details and if you have any discrepancy please let me know.

Steps-1
TIBCO will push xml file in below location
/home/mbas/LOGS/epcXmlReqFile

Steps-2
Scripts:As other scripts in specific location

epcXmlParser.sh
processEpcXmlParser.sh
moveXmlFile.sh

Steps-3

Binary +Lib+xml deploy in below path:

jar+Lib+xml file
/home/mbas/epcXmlParser

Steps-4

After process xml file will move to following location:

/home/mbas/LOGS/epcXmlProFile
line NO:795
transaction api:APP/src/com/comviva/dbill/usage/UsageProcessImp.java
